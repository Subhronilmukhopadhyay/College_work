            <h2 style="color:blueviolet;">About the Solar System</h2>
            <p style="color: crimson;">
                The Solar System, our cosmic neighborhood, is a fascinating place filled with wonders. At its heart lies the Sun, a massive, glowing ball of plasma that provides light and heat to all the celestial bodies orbiting it.<br>
                <br>
                The Sun<br>
                <br>
                The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star, meaning it's middle-aged and stable.<br>
                It's composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, which undergo nuclear fusion, releasing immense energy.<br>
                The Sun's gravity holds the entire solar system together.<br>
                <br>
                The Planets<br>
                <br>
                The solar system has eight planets, divided into two categories:<br>
                <br>
                Terrestrial Planets:<br>
                <br>
                <a href="mercury.html" style="color: brown;">Mercury</a>: The closest planet to the Sun, it's a small, rocky world with extreme temperature fluctuations.<br>
                <a href="venus.html" style="color: brown;">Venus</a>: Known for its thick, toxic atmosphere and scorching surface temperatures.<br>
                <a href="earth.html" style="color: brown;">Earth</a>: Our home planet, the only known place in the universe with life.<br>
                <a href="mars.html" style="color: brown;">Mars</a>: The Red Planet, with its dusty, cold surface and potential for past or present microbial life.<br>
                <br>    
                Gas Giants:<br>
                <br>
                <a href="jupiter.html" style="color: brown;">Jupiter</a>: The largest planet, a gas giant with swirling storms and numerous moons.<br>
                <a href="saturn.html" style="color: brown;">Saturn</a>: Famous for its beautiful rings, composed of ice and rock particles.<br>
                <a href="uranus.html" style="color: brown;">Uranus</a>: An ice giant tilted on its side, with a unique blue-green hue.<br>
                <a href="neptune.html" style="color: brown;">Neptune</a>: The farthest planet from the Sun, a cold, windy world with a deep blue color.<br>
                Other Celestial Bodies<br>
                <br>
                Dwarf Planets: These are smaller than planets but large enough to have a spherical shape. Examples include Pluto, Ceres, Eris, Makemake, and Haumea.<br>
                Moons: Many planets have moons, natural satellites that orbit them. Earth has one moon, while Jupiter has dozens.<br>
                Asteroids: Rocky objects, mostly found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.<br>
                Comets: Icy objects with long, visible tails, often originating from the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud.<br>
                The solar system is a dynamic and ever-changing place. By studying it, we can learn more about the origins of our planet and the universe as a whole.<br>
