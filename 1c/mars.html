            The Red Planet, Mars, is a cold, dusty world with a thin atmosphere.<br>
            A Rusty Landscape:<br>
            Mars' distinctive red color comes from iron oxide, or rust, which covers much of its surface.<br>
            Giant Canyons and Volcanoes:<br>
            The planet boasts the largest canyon in the solar system, Valles Marineris, and the tallest volcano, Olympus Mons.<br>
            Polar Ice Caps:<br>
            Mars has polar ice caps composed of frozen water and carbon dioxide, which grow and shrink with the seasons.<br>
            A Thin Atmosphere:<br>
            Mars' atmosphere is much thinner than Earth's, primarily composed of carbon dioxide.<br>
            Two Tiny Moons:<br>
            Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons: Phobos and Deimos.<br>
            A Potential for Past Life:<br>
            Scientists believe that Mars may have once had liquid water on its surface, raising the possibility of past microbial life.<br>
            A Target for Exploration:<br>
            Mars is a popular target for robotic exploration, with rovers like Curiosity and Perseverance studying its geology and searching for signs of past habitability.<br>
