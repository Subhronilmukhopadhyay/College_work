            Venus, often called Earth's "sister planet," is the second planet from the Sun and the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon.<br>
            A Fiery Hell:<br>
            Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system, with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. This extreme heat is due to a runaway greenhouse effect, where the thick atmosphere traps heat from the Sun.<br>
            A Toxic Atmosphere:<br>
            Venus's atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid. This dense atmosphere creates a crushing pressure at the surface, about 92 times that of Earth's.<br>
            Slow Rotation:<br>
            Venus rotates very slowly on its axis, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation. This slow rotation, combined with its thick atmosphere, contributes to the planet's extreme heat.<br>
            Retrograde Rotation:<br>
            Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets, spinning clockwise when viewed from above the North Pole.<br>
            Volcanic Activity:<br>
            Venus has a volcanic surface, with numerous volcanoes, some of which may still be active. These volcanoes release gases into the atmosphere, contributing to the planet's extreme conditions.<br>
            A Lack of Moons:<br>
            Unlike Earth, Venus has no moons orbiting it.<br>
            A Potential for Life?<br>
            While Venus's surface is inhospitable to life as we know it, some scientists speculate that life might exist in the planet's upper atmosphere, where conditions are less extreme.<br>
