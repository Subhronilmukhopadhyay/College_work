            The Ice Giant:<br>
            Neptune, the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, is an ice giant, primarily composed of a slushy mixture of water, methane, and ammonia.<br>
            A Deep Blue Hue:<br>
            Neptune's distinctive deep blue color is due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light and reflects blue light.<br>
            Supersonic Winds:<br>
            Neptune experiences the strongest winds in the solar system, with speeds reaching up to 2,000 kilometers per hour.<br>
            Faint Rings:<br>
            Like Uranus, Neptune has a system of faint rings, composed of dust and ice particles.<br>
            Numerous Moons:<br>
            Neptune has 14 known moons, the largest of which is Triton, a geologically active world with icy volcanoes.<br>
            Extreme Cold:<br>
            As the farthest planet from the Sun, Neptune experiences extremely cold temperatures, making it one of the coldest places in the solar system.<br>
            A Distant Mystery:<br>
            Due to its great distance from Earth, Neptune remains a mysterious planet, with much to be learned about its atmosphere, interior, and moons.<br>
