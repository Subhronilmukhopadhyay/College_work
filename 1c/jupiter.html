            A Gaseous Giant:<br>
            Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.<br>
            A Rapid Rotator:<br>
            Jupiter spins incredibly fast, completing one rotation in just under 10 hours, causing it to bulge at its equator.<br>
            The Great Red Spot:<br>
            A colossal storm, larger than Earth, has been raging on Jupiter for centuries. This iconic feature is known as the Great Red Spot.<br>
            Numerous Moons:<br>
            Jupiter boasts a vast family of moons, with over 79 currently known. Four of its largest moons, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, are known as the Galilean moons.<br>
            A Faint Ring System:<br>
            Jupiter has a faint ring system composed of dust particles, making it less prominent than Saturn's rings.<br>
            A Powerful Magnetic Field:<br>
            Jupiter possesses a powerful magnetic field, generating intense auroras near its poles.<br>
            A Potential for Life?<br>
            While Jupiter itself is inhospitable to life, some of its moons, particularly Europa, are considered potential candidates for harboring microbial life beneath their icy surfaces.<br>
